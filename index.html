     <p>I have an idea to improve on the already high percentage of hired Lambda grads. In the top left corner of the page you will see "Lambda Certified Partner".  The idea is that tech companies will partner with Lambda in more of a strategic way than they already do.  Imagine this scenario, "tech company A" needs 10 developers by the end of september and Lambda has a web class ending early september.  With "tech company A" being a "Lambda certified partner", they would provide you with key training conditions that the 10 developers would need to focus on. Having the last sprint of instruction targeted specifically towards "tech company A" will allow for an easy and more profitable transition for them.  This will not add time to Lambda's cirriculum, it should be included in the last sprint.  </p>
